#__GPS2TEC__

This prohram is for calculate total electron content(TEC) from gps signal



#Directory and file discription:

__bin/__  : some binary files (different version of crx2rnx)

__gps2tec_modules/__  : subroutines

__gps2tec.inp__ :  input file 

__gps2tec.py__  : main program 

__marker.crd__  : gps station xyz coordinate list 

#Input file discription:
__case_type__  : 

                 local  -- Calculate GPSTEC from o file in current directory

                 IGS    -- Download GPS source file from IGS(International GNSS Service) and calculate TEC
                        
                 IGSRT  -- Download real-time GPS source file from IGS and calculate TEC
            
__year__     : Year of run time.

__save_pwd__ : 

    Specifies the save directory and it will create directory by different days(e.g. /path_to_save/YYYY/DDD) in this directory.

    If set empty,  it will create directory at current directory.

__st_doy__  : Start DOY of run time. (for case_type IGS and local)

__ed_doy__  : End DOY of run time. (for case_type IGS and local)

__download_list_fn__ : Specifies the GPS station list filename for downloading from IGS. The GPS station list file should have different station name in different line, and have station name in first 4 char in each line. If set empty, it will download al GPS data from IGS. (for case_type IGS)


__doy__ : DOY of run time. (for case_type IGSRT)

__hh__  : Hour of run time. (for case_type IGSRT)
 
__mm__  : Minute of run time. (for case_type IGSRT)

__gim_days_before__   : Download GIM data the days before the run time. (for case_type IGSRT)

__time_delay_minute__ : This number should depend on [mm]. Because real-time GPS data is release at 15, 30, 45 minute each hour, so [Minute of run time] - [time_delay_minute] should be 15, 30 or 45.

__stnbias_method__ : Station bias method.

                     GIM      -- Calculate station bias by the value and the time of GIM minimum TEC.
                     
                     FITTING  -- Calculate station bias by fitting (M.Y. Chou and H.F. Tsai)
                     
__elevation_angle__ : Elevtion angle.

__h1_km__  : Upper boundary of ionosphere height (km). 

__h2_km__  : Lower boundary of ionosphere height (km).

__multiprocess_numbers__ : Specifies how many process you want use for calculate GPSTEC in the same time.
